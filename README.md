# Animge

Simple AI text-to-image generator desktop app (work-in-progress)

## On-hold

Unable to create an executable for the electron app to start the local fastapi server, because there is complications with the diffusers and pytorch packages. Going to work on other projects for now, maybe work on the ui when I feel like it.
